					<h3>Windell H. A. Murphy, MD, FAAO</h3>
					</br>
					<p><img src="http://windellmurphymd.com/wpimages/wp3340b3ac_05.jpg" align="left">
					Dr. Murphy was born in Belize City, Belize, in Central America. Upon graduating from high school, he worked with the Government of Belize for two years as a Lands Inspector in the Lands and Survey Department.
					</br></br>He migrated to the US in 1972 and in 1973 enrolled at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. While studying his courses at Medgar Evers College he decided he wanted to become a doctor. He transferred to Brooklyn College after the summer of 1974 where he majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in 1977.
					</br></br>To continue on his track to become a doctor he enrolled in the Albert Einstein Medical School in the Bronx, New York in 1977. During both junior and senior years of his clinical internal medicine rotations at Montefiore Hospital he earned the grade of honors with distinction. He had enjoyed his surgical rotations and felt he would enter a specialty that would combine both internal medicine and surgery. Ophthalmology emerged as that specialty since he was curious about the diseases and medical and surgical therapy that could affect the eye.
					</br></br>Upon graduating with a Medical Doctor’s degree from Albert Einstein Medical School in 1981, he went to Boston for his mandatory year of internship. He trained during his internship in Internal Medicine at Harvard’s Beth Israel Hospital in Boston Massachusetts. He graduated his internship in 1982.
					</br></br>Dr. Murphy started his specialty training in ophthalmology in 1982 at The Scheie Eye Institute of The University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. There he learned how to identify eye diseases and how to effectively manage these problems using laser therapy and other surgical techniques. He learned that just about no one should have to go blind from diabetic eye diseases if appropriate therapy is commenced early and careful follow up is pursued. He also learned that Glaucoma blinds far too many people in the years of life when they have placed the highest value on sight. He graduated in 1985 and achieved board certification as a Fellow of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
					</br></br>Dr. Murphy lives in Philadelphia with his wife and two children. He has been the Director of Ophthalmology at Mercy Hospital of Philadelphia since 1985. His special interest at present is the treatment of Glaucoma, Cataracts, Laser Therapy for Diabetes and Glaucoma and performing second opinions “…because there are too many patients that have not had things (their problems) explained to them in a manner in which they can understand it.”</p>
